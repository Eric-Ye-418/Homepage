Diﬀerent from usual sudden quench, we study the non-adiabatic dynamical classiﬁcation scheme by a generic non-adiabatic protocol of slowly quenching the system Hamiltonian, which is realized by introducing a Coulomb-like Landau Zener problem. the new scheme can provides a more eﬃcient dynamical characterization approach for ultracold-atom experiments."""
